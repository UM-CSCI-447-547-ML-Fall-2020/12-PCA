    "This notebook deals with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a method for finding a new (and hopefully more efficient) representation of continuously valued features.  PCA is used for two primary tasks.  The first is the analysis of combinations of independent variables in an effort to describe the patterns underlying features in a more concise way.  The second and more ubiquitous use is for dimensionality reduction: throwing away data that is redundant or non-explanatory.  Let's look at an example for what we mean by this."

This is sort of like linear regression, but with an important distinction: in linear regression the thing that was being minimized was the vertical difference between the line and the dependent variable.  In this case, we're drawing the line that minimizes the distance *perpendicular* (or orthogonal) to the line.  This is the result of the fact that this algorithm is unsupervised: no variable is any more special than any other in this case.  However, this does help us to come up with a second interpretation of the first principal component: it is the line that passes closest to the data points.\n",

This can be seen by the fact that there is only one parameter ($\\theta$) in a 2D rotation matrix.  This is not the case for higher dimensions.  However, the procedure can be applied recursively: the second principal component is the direction that maximizes the explained variance, excluding the variance explained by the first principal component.  Fortunately, the math doesn't change; we still find the principal components by computing the sample covariance, finding its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and sorting these from largest to smallest.  The eigenvalues from largest to smallest still represent the amount of variance accounted for in the direction of their associated eigenvector/principal component.  \n",
